# The meta-concepts of data analysis, workflows and projects in R.  

This is a place to collaborate on resources and to discuss the 
meta-concepts of data analysis.  

The format will likely evolve, but if you would like to contribute, feel free
to PR any resources or ideas, or just submit an issue for discussion.  

## The idea  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think an underated skill is guessing how much complexity a project will have before you start, and picking an appropriate workflow.</p>&mdash; Dean Marchiori (@deanmarchiori) <a href="https://twitter.com/deanmarchiori/status/1235361729221099522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote>
